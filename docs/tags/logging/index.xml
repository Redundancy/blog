      <description>Logging is an area of engineering that isn&amp;rsquo;t really discussed enough.
At some point early during our careers, someone shows us how to debug stuff with print statements, console.log or one of the other variations and we are set. At a later point, someone shows us centralized logging with all our logs going to ELK or Splunk, and now we&amp;rsquo;re able to do the same sort of thing with loads of servers at once.</description>
